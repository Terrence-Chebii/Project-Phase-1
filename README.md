# Anime-Hub
Anime-Hub is a web application that lets users discover
and explore anime content. The application fetches data 
from the Jikan API to display a variety of anime content, 
including new releases, trending content, and global 
favorites. Users can also search for specific anime titles 
and add them to their own personal list of liked anime.

It provides the latest and the best animes in different 
categories globally and locally. Users can also like their
 favorite anime by clicking the heart button and they can 
 see their liked animes by clicking the Liked Anime's 
 button.


# How the project works
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
 HTML and CSS files are used for the layout and styling of
  the website. The JavaScript file is used to fetch data 
  from the Jikan API and to manipulate the DOM.


When the user clicks on the Home button, the function 
displayHome is triggered. The displayHome function fetches
 data from the Jikan API to display the best animes 
 globally, new releases, and trending animes locally. Each
  anime is displayed with a heart button that allows the 
  user to like the anime.

When the user clicks on the Liked Anime's button, a list 
of their liked animes is displayed. The Liked Anime's 
button does not trigger any function but only changes the
 display.

When the user clicks on the Filter button, the filter 
options are displayed.

When the user enters an anime name in the input field and
 clicks the ðŸ”Ž button, the function searchAnime is
  triggered. The searchAnime function fetches data from
   the Jikan API to display the anime that the user
    searched for. Each anime is displayed with a heart
     button that allows the user to like the anime.

When the user enters an anime name in the input field of 
the ADD ANIME form and clicks the âž• button, the function 
addAnime is triggered. The addAnime function adds the 
anime to the list of liked animes.

The liked animes are stored on a local server. When the 
user likes an anime, the anime is posted to the server 
using a POST request. When the user clicks on the Liked
 Anime's button, the liked animes are fetched from the 
 server and displayed.
